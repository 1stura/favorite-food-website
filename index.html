            <h2>What is Chicken Katsu?</h2>
            <p>Chicken katsu is a beloved Japanese dish featuring a crispy, deep-fried chicken cutlet coated in panko breadcrumbs. It's typically served with a savory tonkatsu sauce, shredded cabbage, and rice.
                <br>
            This flavorful dish is known for its satisfying crunch, tender meat, and irresistible combination of textures and flavors.
            <br>
            It was originally invented in Tokyo during the late 1800's by an unnamed restaurant who wanted to replicate european style meat. Perhaps that's why the dish is so popular among Europeans and Americans.</p>
